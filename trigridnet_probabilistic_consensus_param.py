# This simulation tests the consensus achievement algorithm (collective decision making
# algorithm) on randomly generated 2D triangle grid network. The algorithm is extracted
# from previous loop reshape simulations for further testing, so that it can be generalized
# to 2D random network topologies. The distribution evolution method is similar to the
# loop reshape simulation, except more than three nodes are involved in the weighted
# averaging process.

# input arguments:
# '-f': filename of the triangle grid network
# '-d': number of decisions each node can choose from
# '-r': repeat times of simulation, with different initial random distribution; default=0
# '--nobargraph': option to skip the bar graph visualization

# Pygame will be used to animate the dynamic group changes in the network;
# Matplotlib will be used to draw the unipolarity in a 3D bar graph, the whole decision
# distribution is not necessary.

# Algorithm to update the groups in 2D triangle grid network:
# Using a pool of indices for nodes that have not been grouped, those labeled into a
# group will be remove from the pool. As long as the pool is not enpty, a while loop
# will continue searching groups one by one. In the loop, it initialize a new group
# with first node in the pool. It also initialize a fifo-like variable(p_members) for
# potential members of this group, and an index variable(p_index) for iterating through
# the potential members. If p_members[p_index] doesn't share same decidion with first node,
# p_index increases by 1, will check next value in p_members. If it does, then a new member
# for this group has been found, it will be removed from the pool and p_members, and added
# to current group. The new group member will also introduce its neighbors as new
# potential members, but they should not be in p_members and current group, and should be
# in node pool. The member search for this group will end if p_index iterates to the end
# of p_members.

# Adding another experiment scenario: for 100 nodes, forcing 10 closely located nodes to
# have a specific decision (colored in blue), and in the half way toward consensus, seed
# 20 "stubborn" nodes that won't change their mind at all. Ideally the collective decision
# will reverse to the one insisted by the new 20 nodes.
# (The program is really messy now.)

# (an excursion of thought)
# Writing a paper and keep revising it totally ruin the fun of developping this simulation.
# Writing paper is boring to many people I know, but it's specially painful to me in a
# subconscious way. I have very strong personal style which runs through every aspect of my
# life, and the style does not mix well with academia. I love simplicity, elegance, and truth.
# I rarely claim something in my belief, but these I am very proud to have, and have no
# intention to compromise them with anything. Academic paper as a form to present the
# state-of-the-art, and to communicate thought, should contain succinct and honest description
# of the work. However the two advisors I have worked with (I respect them from the deep of my
# heart) both revised my papers toward being more acceptable by the publishers. Most of the
# changes like pharsing and some of the restructuring are very good, reflecting their years of
# academic training. They make the paper more explicit and easy to understand. Others changes,
# IMHO, are simply trying to elevate the paper, so on first read people would think this is
# a very good one by those abstract words. This is what makes me suffer. These changes are
# steering the paper to the opposite of succinct and honesty. For example, if it is only a
# method to solve a specific problem, saying it is a systematic approach to solve a series
# of problem, and using abstract words for the technical terms, does not make the work any
# better. It would only confuse the readers and let them spend more time to dig out the idea.
# I could never fight my advisors on these changes, they would say it is just a style of
# writing, and it brings out the potential of the work. This is like to say, our presented
# technology can do this, can do that, and potentially it could do much more amazing things.
# I totally hate the last part! It just give people a chance to bragging things they would
# never reach. As I find out, quite a few published papers that I believe I understand every
# bit of it, are trying to elevate their content to a level they don't deserve. If I were to
# rewrite them, I would cut all the crap and leave only the naked truth and idea. Many
# researcher picked up this habit in their training with publishing papers, like an untold
# rule. As for my paper, I really wish my work were that good to be entitled to those words,
# but they are not. Academia is a sublime place in many people's thinking, as in mine. I have
# very high standards for the graduation of a PhD. If I kept following my style, and be honest
# with myself, I knew long ago I would never graduate. I am loving it too much to hate it.
# (addition to the simulation)
# Requested by the paper, when visualizing the bar graph for the discrete entropy, adding the
# summation of all discrete entropy to show how the entropy reduction works.
